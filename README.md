kody_env
========

My kody environment folder for my personal .files.

Feel free to fork from mine!

Check out [kody](https://github.com/jh3y/kody).

# usage

1. Install `homebrew` on machine
2. Install `node` and `git` via `homebrew` (_saves from possible issues later down the line and means everything is managed by brew_)
3. Install `kody`
4. Clone `kody_env` and run `kody` within the cloned repo
5. All good :sunglasses:
